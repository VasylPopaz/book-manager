# Book Manager

Book Manager is a web application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and
**Vite** for managing a collection of books. The app allows users to efficiently
add, edit, and delete books, search through the collection by keywords, and sort
the list of books by various attributes, such as title, author, ISBN, and
status.

This application is ideal for individuals or teams looking to organize their
book inventory, whether it's a personal library, a small bookstore, or a larger
collection.

  longer needed or relevant. The delete function ensures smooth removal while

  users search through the collection using keywords. The search is applied
  across multiple fields (title, author, ISBN), making it easy to find specific
